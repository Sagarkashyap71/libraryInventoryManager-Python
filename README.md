# libraryInventoryManager-Python
A simple and efficient library management system built using Python and OOP concepts. It allows users to add books,
issue and return books, search by title or ISBN, and view all available books. The project uses a JSON file to 
store book records permanently and includes logging for all major actions. A menu-driven CLI makes it easy to navigate
and manage the library.
